<h2>Problem Statement Instructions</h2>

Design a problem that comes from real-world applications and design solutions to solve the problem. 
The problem can be totally new (from your own investigation) or from other sources 
	(e.g., a kaggle competition problem, a problem defined in a recent research article). 
The problem can also be part of a problem that you are currently working on (e.g., towards your PhD dissertation, or Master’s project, or Master’s thesis).

* **Motivation:** Please clearly describe the applications/motivations of the problem.
* **Problem:** Clearly define the problem.
* **Solution:** Design reasonable solutions to solve the problem by utilizing the machine learning knowledge that you have learned and making use of other related machine learning tools.
* **Data:** Obtain proper datasets to test your solution. You can use self-created datasets or publicly available datasets. 
	If you utilize existing datasets, they had better be reasonably big in size (e.g., with more than 10K instances). 
	If you create your own datasets (e.g., by writing script to crawl data), your dataset may not be huge in size 
	(e.g., with several hundreds of instances).
* **Analysis:** Properly analyze the performance of your solution.
